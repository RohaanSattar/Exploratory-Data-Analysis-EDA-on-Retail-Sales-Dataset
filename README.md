# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-Retail-Sales-Dataset
In this project, I analyzed the Superstore Sales dataset to extract business-driven insights. The goal was to understand how sales, discounts, and profitability vary across different categories, customer segments, and regions.

# Steps I performed:

Data Cleaning – handled missing values, corrected data types, removed inconsistencies.

Univariate Analysis – explored individual variables like Sales, Profit, Discount, and Category distribution.

Bivariate Analysis – studied relationships such as Sales vs Profit, Discount vs Profit, Category vs Sales/Profit, Region vs Sales, Segment vs Profit.

Time Series Analysis – tracked yearly sales growth trends.

Business Insights – identified best-selling and loss-making products, profit trends, and the effect of discounts on profitability.

# Key Insights:

Technology emerged as the most profitable category, while Furniture showed inconsistent profits.

Higher discounts often reduced profitability, signaling the need for a controlled discount strategy.

The West and East regions contributed the most to overall sales, but profitability varied significantly.

Certain products drove high sales but also resulted in losses, requiring pricing and discount policy review.
